.SH PURPOSE
ZHEMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

or
.br

   C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,
.br

where alpha and beta are scalars, A is an hermitian matrix and  B and
C are m by n matrices.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 7
SIDE   - CHARACTER*1.
On entry,  SIDE  specifies whether  the  hermitian matrix  A
appears on the  left or right  in the  operation as follows:

SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq   C := alpha*A*B + beta*C,

SIDE = \(aqR\(aq or \(aqr\(aq   C := alpha*B*A + beta*C,

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
On  entry,   UPLO  specifies  whether  the  upper  or  lower
triangular  part  of  the  hermitian  matrix   A  is  to  be
referenced as follows:

UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq   Only the upper triangular part of the
hermitian matrix is to be referenced.

UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq   Only the lower triangular part of the
hermitian matrix is to be referenced.

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
M      - INTEGER.
On entry,  M  specifies the number of rows of the matrix  C.
M  must be at least zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
N      - INTEGER.
On entry, N specifies the number of columns of the matrix C.
N  must be at least zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
ALPHA  - COMPLEX*16      .
On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
A      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
m  when  SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq  and is n  otherwise.
Before entry  with  SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq,  the  m by m  part of
the array  A  must contain the  hermitian matrix,  such that
when  UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq, the leading m by m upper triangular
part of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular part
of the  hermitian matrix and the  strictly  lower triangular
part of  A  is not referenced,  and when  UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq,
the leading  m by m  lower triangular part  of the  array  A
must  contain  the  lower triangular part  of the  hermitian
matrix and the  strictly upper triangular part of  A  is not
referenced.
Before entry  with  SIDE = \(aqR\(aq or \(aqr\(aq,  the  n by n  part of
the array  A  must contain the  hermitian matrix,  such that
when  UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq, the leading n by n upper triangular
part of the array  A  must contain the upper triangular part
of the  hermitian matrix and the  strictly  lower triangular
part of  A  is not referenced,  and when  UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq,
the leading  n by n  lower triangular part  of the  array  A
must  contain  the  lower triangular part  of the  hermitian
matrix and the  strictly upper triangular part of  A  is not
referenced.
Note that the imaginary parts  of the diagonal elements need
not be set, they are assumed to be zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
LDA    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
in the  calling (sub) program. When  SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq  then
LDA must be at least  max( 1, m ), otherwise  LDA must be at
least max( 1, n ).
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
B      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDB, n ).
Before entry, the leading  m by n part of the array  B  must
contain the matrix B.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
LDB    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be  at  least
max( 1, m ).
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
BETA   - COMPLEX*16      .
On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.  When  BETA  is
supplied as zero then C need not be set on input.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
C      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ).
Before entry, the leading  m by n  part of the array  C must
contain the matrix  C,  except when  beta  is zero, in which
case C need not be set on entry.
On exit, the array  C  is overwritten by the  m by n updated
matrix.
.TP 7
LDC    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
max( 1, m ).
Unchanged on exit.
