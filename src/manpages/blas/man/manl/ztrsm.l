.SH PURPOSE
ZTRSM  solves one of the matrix equations

where alpha is a scalar, X and B are m by n matrices, A is a unit, or
non-unit,  upper or lower triangular matrix  and  op( A )  is one  of

   op( A ) = A   or   op( A ) = A\(aq   or   op( A ) = conjg( A\(aq ).

The matrix X is overwritten on B.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 7
SIDE   - CHARACTER*1.
On entry, SIDE specifies whether op( A ) appears on the left
or right of X as follows:

SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq   op( A )*X = alpha*B.

SIDE = \(aqR\(aq or \(aqr\(aq   X*op( A ) = alpha*B.

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
UPLO   - CHARACTER*1.
On entry, UPLO specifies whether the matrix A is an upper or
lower triangular matrix as follows:

UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq   A is an upper triangular matrix.

UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq   A is a lower triangular matrix.

Unchanged on exit.

TRANSA - CHARACTER*1.
On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
the matrix multiplication as follows:

TRANSA = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq   op( A ) = A.

TRANSA = \(aqT\(aq or \(aqt\(aq   op( A ) = A\(aq.

TRANSA = \(aqC\(aq or \(aqc\(aq   op( A ) = conjg( A\(aq ).

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
DIAG   - CHARACTER*1.
On entry, DIAG specifies whether or not A is unit triangular
as follows:

DIAG = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq   A is assumed to be unit triangular.

DIAG = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq   A is not assumed to be unit
triangular.

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
M      - INTEGER.
On entry, M specifies the number of rows of B. M must be at
least zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
N      - INTEGER.
On entry, N specifies the number of columns of B.  N must be
at least zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
ALPHA  - COMPLEX*16      .
On entry,  ALPHA specifies the scalar  alpha. When  alpha is
zero then  A is not referenced and  B need not be set before
entry.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
A      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDA, k ), where k is m
when  SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq  and is  n  when  SIDE = \(aqR\(aq or \(aqr\(aq.
Before entry  with  UPLO = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq,  the  leading  k by k
upper triangular part of the array  A must contain the upper
triangular matrix  and the strictly lower triangular part of
A is not referenced.
Before entry  with  UPLO = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq,  the  leading  k by k
lower triangular part of the array  A must contain the lower
triangular matrix  and the strictly upper triangular part of
A is not referenced.
Note that when  DIAG = \(aqU\(aq or \(aqu\(aq,  the diagonal elements of
A  are not referenced either,  but are assumed to be  unity.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
LDA    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
in the calling (sub) program.  When  SIDE = \(aqL\(aq or \(aql\(aq  then
LDA  must be at least  max( 1, m ),  when  SIDE = \(aqR\(aq or \(aqr\(aq
then LDA must be at least max( 1, n ).
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
B      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDB, n ).
Before entry,  the leading  m by n part of the array  B must
contain  the  right-hand  side  matrix  B,  and  on exit  is
overwritten by the solution matrix  X.
.TP 7
LDB    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDB  must  be  at  least
max( 1, m ).
Unchanged on exit.
