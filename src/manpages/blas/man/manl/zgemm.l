.SH PURPOSE
ZGEMM  performs one of the matrix-matrix operations

where  op( X ) is one of
.br

   op( X ) = X   or   op( X ) = X\(aq   or   op( X ) = conjg( X\(aq ),

alpha and beta are scalars, and A, B and C are matrices, with op( A )
an m by k matrix,  op( B )  a  k by n matrix and  C an m by n matrix.

.SH ARGUMENTS

TRANSA - CHARACTER*1.
On entry, TRANSA specifies the form of op( A ) to be used in
the matrix multiplication as follows:

TRANSA = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  op( A ) = A.

TRANSA = \(aqT\(aq or \(aqt\(aq,  op( A ) = A\(aq.

TRANSA = \(aqC\(aq or \(aqc\(aq,  op( A ) = conjg( A\(aq ).

Unchanged on exit.

TRANSB - CHARACTER*1.
On entry, TRANSB specifies the form of op( B ) to be used in
the matrix multiplication as follows:

TRANSB = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  op( B ) = B.

TRANSB = \(aqT\(aq or \(aqt\(aq,  op( B ) = B\(aq.

TRANSB = \(aqC\(aq or \(aqc\(aq,  op( B ) = conjg( B\(aq ).

Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
M      - INTEGER.
On entry,  M  specifies  the number  of rows  of the  matrix
op( A )  and of the  matrix  C.  M  must  be at least  zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
N      - INTEGER.
On entry,  N  specifies the number  of columns of the matrix
op( B ) and the number of columns of the matrix C. N must be
at least zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
K      - INTEGER.
On entry,  K  specifies  the number of columns of the matrix
op( A ) and the number of rows of the matrix op( B ). K must
be at least  zero.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
ALPHA  - COMPLEX*16      .
On entry, ALPHA specifies the scalar alpha.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
A      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDA, ka ), where ka is
k  when  TRANSA = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  and is  m  otherwise.
Before entry with  TRANSA = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  the leading  m by k
part of the array  A  must contain the matrix  A,  otherwise
the leading  k by m  part of the array  A  must contain  the
matrix A.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
LDA    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
in the calling (sub) program. When  TRANSA = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq then
LDA must be at least  max( 1, m ), otherwise  LDA must be at
least  max( 1, k ).
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
B      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDB, kb ), where kb is
n  when  TRANSB = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  and is  k  otherwise.
Before entry with  TRANSB = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq,  the leading  k by n
part of the array  B  must contain the matrix  B,  otherwise
the leading  n by k  part of the array  B  must contain  the
matrix B.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
LDB    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDB specifies the first dimension of B as declared
in the calling (sub) program. When  TRANSB = \(aqN\(aq or \(aqn\(aq then
LDB must be at least  max( 1, k ), otherwise  LDB must be at
least  max( 1, n ).
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
BETA   - COMPLEX*16      .
On entry,  BETA  specifies the scalar  beta.  When  BETA  is
supplied as zero then C need not be set on input.
Unchanged on exit.
.TP 7
C      - COMPLEX*16       array of DIMENSION ( LDC, n ).
Before entry, the leading  m by n  part of the array  C must
contain the matrix  C,  except when  beta  is zero, in which
case C need not be set on entry.
On exit, the array  C  is overwritten by the  m by n  matrix
( alpha*op( A )*op( B ) + beta*C ).
.TP 7
LDC    - INTEGER.
On entry, LDC specifies the first dimension of C as declared
in  the  calling  (sub)  program.   LDC  must  be  at  least
max( 1, m ).
Unchanged on exit.
