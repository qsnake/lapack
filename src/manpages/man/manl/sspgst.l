.SH PURPOSE
SSPGST reduces a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem
to standard form, using packed storage.

If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
.br
and A is overwritten by inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T)

If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
.br
B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.

B must have been previously factorized as U**T*U or L*L**T by SPPTRF.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
ITYPE   (input) INTEGER
= 1: compute inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T);
.br
= 2 or 3: compute U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
.br
= \(aqU\(aq:  Upper triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
U**T*U;
= \(aqL\(aq:  Lower triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
L*L**T.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
On entry, the upper or lower triangle of the symmetric matrix
A, packed columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A
is stored in the array AP as follows:
if UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
if UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.

On exit, if INFO = 0, the transformed matrix, stored in the
same format as A.
.TP 8
BP      (input) REAL array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The triangular factor from the Cholesky factorization of B,
stored in the same format as A, as returned by SPPTRF.
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
