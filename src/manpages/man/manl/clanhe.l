.SH PURPOSE
CLANHE  returns the value of the one norm,  or the Frobenius norm, or
the  infinity norm,  or the  element of  largest absolute value  of a
complex hermitian matrix A.

.SH DESCRIPTION
CLANHE returns the value
.br

   CLANHE = ( max(abs(A(i,j))), NORM = \(aqM\(aq or \(aqm\(aq
.br
            (
.br
            ( norm1(A),         NORM = \(aq1\(aq, \(aqO\(aq or \(aqo\(aq
.br
            (
.br
            ( normI(A),         NORM = \(aqI\(aq or \(aqi\(aq
.br
            (
.br
            ( normF(A),         NORM = \(aqF\(aq, \(aqf\(aq, \(aqE\(aq or \(aqe\(aq

where  norm1  denotes the  one norm of a matrix (maximum column sum),
normI  denotes the  infinity norm  of a matrix  (maximum row sum) and
normF  denotes the  Frobenius norm of a matrix (square root of sum of
squares).  Note that  max(abs(A(i,j)))  is not a consistent matrix norm.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies the value to be returned in CLANHE as described
above.
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
hermitian matrix A is to be referenced.
= \(aqU\(aq:  Upper triangular part of A is referenced
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  Lower triangular part of A is referenced
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.  When N = 0, CLANHE is
set to zero.
.TP 8
A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
The hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, the leading n by n
upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part
of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A
is not referenced.  If UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, the leading n by n lower
triangular part of A contains the lower triangular part of
the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is
not referenced. Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal
elements need not be set and are assumed to be zero.
.TP 8
LDA     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(N,1).
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)),
where LWORK >= N when NORM = \(aqI\(aq or \(aq1\(aq or \(aqO\(aq; otherwise,
WORK is not referenced.
