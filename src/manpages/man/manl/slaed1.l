.SH PURPOSE
SLAED1 computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal
matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix.  This
routine is used only for the eigenproblem which requires all
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix.  SLAED7 handles
the case in which eigenvalues only or eigenvalues and eigenvectors
of a full symmetric matrix (which was reduced to tridiagonal form)
are desired.
.br

  T = Q(in) ( D(in) + RHO * Z*Z\(aq ) Q\(aq(in) = Q(out) * D(out) * Q\(aq(out)

   where Z = Q\(aqu, u is a vector of length N with ones in the
   CUTPNT and CUTPNT + 1 th elements and zeros elsewhere.

   The eigenvectors of the original matrix are stored in Q, and the
   eigenvalues are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

      The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
      when there are multiple eigenvalues or if there is a zero in
      the Z vector.  For each such occurence the dimension of the
      secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
      performed by the routine SLAED2.
.br

      The second stage consists of calculating the updated
      eigenvalues. This is done by finding the roots of the secular
      equation via the routine SLAED4 (as called by SLAED3).
      This routine also calculates the eigenvectors of the current
      problem.
.br

      The final stage consists of computing the updated eigenvectors
      directly using the updated eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors for
      the current problem are multiplied with the eigenvectors from
      the overall problem.
