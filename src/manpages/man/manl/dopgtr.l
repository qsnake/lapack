.SH PURPOSE
DOPGTR generates a real orthogonal matrix Q which is defined as the
product of n-1 elementary reflectors H(i) of order n, as returned by
DSPTRD using packed storage:

if UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, Q = H(n-1) . . . H(2) H(1),
.br

if UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, Q = H(1) H(2) . . . H(n-1).
.br

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
= \(aqU\(aq: Upper triangular packed storage used in previous
call to DSPTRD;
= \(aqL\(aq: Lower triangular packed storage used in previous
call to DSPTRD.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix Q. N >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The vectors which define the elementary reflectors, as
returned by DSPTRD.
.TP 8
TAU     (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
reflector H(i), as returned by DSPTRD.
.TP 8
Q       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ,N)
The N-by-N orthogonal matrix Q.
.TP 8
LDQ     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array Q. LDQ >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N-1)
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
