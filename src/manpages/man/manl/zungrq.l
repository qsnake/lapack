.SH PURPOSE
ZUNGRQ generates an M-by-N complex matrix Q with orthonormal rows,
which is defined as the last M rows of a product of K elementary
reflectors of order N
.br

      Q  =  H(1)\(aq H(2)\(aq . . . H(k)\(aq
.br

as returned by ZGERQF.
.br

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
M       (input) INTEGER
The number of rows of the matrix Q. M >= 0.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The number of columns of the matrix Q. N >= M.
.TP 8
K       (input) INTEGER
The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines the
matrix Q. M >= K >= 0.
.TP 8
A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
On entry, the (m-k+i)-th row must contain the vector which
defines the elementary reflector H(i), for i = 1,2,...,k, as
returned by ZGERQF in the last k rows of its array argument
A.
On exit, the M-by-N matrix Q.
.TP 8
LDA     (input) INTEGER
The first dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,M).
.TP 8
TAU     (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (K)
TAU(i) must contain the scalar factor of the elementary
reflector H(i), as returned by ZGERQF.
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal LWORK.
.TP 8
LWORK   (input) INTEGER
The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,M).
For optimum performance LWORK >= M*NB, where NB is the
optimal blocksize.

If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument has an illegal value
