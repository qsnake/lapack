.SH PURPOSE
SGBRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is banded, and provides
error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies the form of the system of equations:
.br
= \(aqN\(aq:  A * X = B     (No transpose)
.br
= \(aqT\(aq:  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
.br
= \(aqC\(aq:  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
KL      (input) INTEGER
The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
.TP 8
KU      (input) INTEGER
The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
.TP 8
NRHS    (input) INTEGER
The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
.TP 8
AB      (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAB,N)
The original band matrix A, stored in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.
The j-th column of A is stored in the j-th column of the
array AB as follows:
AB(ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(n,j+kl).
.TP 8
LDAB    (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
.TP 8
AFB     (input) REAL array, dimension (LDAFB,N)
Details of the LU factorization of the band matrix A, as
computed by SGBTRF.  U is stored as an upper triangular band
matrix with KL+KU superdiagonals in rows 1 to KL+KU+1, and
the multipliers used during the factorization are stored in
rows KL+KU+2 to 2*KL+KU+1.
.TP 8
LDAFB   (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array AFB.  LDAFB >= 2*KL*KU+1.
.TP 8
IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
The pivot indices from SGBTRF; for 1<=i<=N, row i of the
matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).
.TP 8
B       (input) REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
The right hand side matrix B.
.TP 8
LDB     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
X       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGBTRS.
On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
.TP 8
LDX     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
FERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
overestimate of the true error.
.TP 8
BERR    (output) REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) REAL array, dimension (3*N)
.TP 8
IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
.SH PARAMETERS

ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
