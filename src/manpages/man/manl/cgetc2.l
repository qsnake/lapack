.SH PURPOSE
CGETC2 computes an LU factorization, using complete pivoting, of the
n-by-n matrix A. The factorization has the form A = P * L * U * Q,
where P and Q are permutation matrices, L is lower triangular with
unit diagonal elements and U is upper triangular.
.br

This is a level 1 BLAS version of the algorithm.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A. N >= 0.
.TP 8
A       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA, N)
On entry, the n-by-n matrix to be factored.
On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
A = P*L*U*Q; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.
If U(k, k) appears to be less than SMIN, U(k, k) is given the
value of SMIN, giving a nonsingular perturbed system.
.TP 8
LDA     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1, N).
.TP 8
IPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N).
The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the
matrix has been interchanged with row IPIV(i).
.TP 8
JPIV    (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N).
The pivot indices; for 1 <= j <= N, column j of the
matrix has been interchanged with column JPIV(j).
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0: successful exit
.br
> 0: if INFO = k, U(k, k) is likely to produce overflow if
one tries to solve for x in Ax = b. So U is perturbed
to avoid the overflow.
