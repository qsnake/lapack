.SH PURPOSE
ZSPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number (in the
1-norm) of a complex symmetric packed matrix A using the
factorization A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by ZSPTRF.

An estimate is obtained for norm(inv(A)), and the reciprocal of the
condition number is computed as RCOND = 1 / (ANORM * norm(inv(A))).

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
= \(aqU\(aq:  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZSPTRF, stored as a
packed triangular matrix.
.TP 8
IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
as determined by ZSPTRF.
.TP 8
ANORM   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
The 1-norm of the original matrix A.
.TP 8
RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
computed as RCOND = 1/(ANORM * AINVNM), where AINVNM is an
estimate of the 1-norm of inv(A) computed in this routine.
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
