.SH PURPOSE
ZTPCON estimates the reciprocal of the condition number of a packed
triangular matrix A, in either the 1-norm or the infinity-norm.

The norm of A is computed and an estimate is obtained for
norm(inv(A)), then the reciprocal of the condition number is
computed as
.br
   RCOND = 1 / ( norm(A) * norm(inv(A)) ).
.br

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
NORM    (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies whether the 1-norm condition number or the
infinity-norm condition number is required:
.br
= \(aq1\(aq or \(aqO\(aq:  1-norm;
.br
= \(aqI\(aq:         Infinity-norm.
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
.br
= \(aqU\(aq:  A is upper triangular;
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  A is lower triangular.
.TP 8
DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
.br
= \(aqN\(aq:  A is non-unit triangular;
.br
= \(aqU\(aq:  A is unit triangular.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
AP as follows:
if UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
if UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*(2n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
If DIAG = \(aqU\(aq, the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
and are assumed to be 1.
.TP 8
RCOND   (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
The reciprocal of the condition number of the matrix A,
computed as RCOND = 1/(norm(A) * norm(inv(A))).
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
.TP 8
RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
