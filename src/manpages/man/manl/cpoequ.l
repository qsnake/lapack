.SH PURPOSE
CPOEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate a
Hermitian positive definite matrix A and reduce its condition number
(with respect to the two-norm).  S contains the scale factors,
S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled matrix B with
elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the diagonal.  This
choice of S puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the
smallest possible condition number over all possible diagonal
scalings.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
The N-by-N Hermitian positive definite matrix whose scaling
factors are to be computed.  Only the diagonal elements of A
are referenced.
.TP 8
LDA     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
S       (output) REAL array, dimension (N)
If INFO = 0, S contains the scale factors for A.
.TP 8
SCOND   (output) REAL
If INFO = 0, S contains the ratio of the smallest S(i) to
the largest S(i).  If SCOND >= 0.1 and AMAX is neither too
large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by S.
.TP 8
AMAX    (output) REAL
Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
should be scaled.
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
.br
> 0:  if INFO = i, the i-th diagonal element is nonpositive.
