.SH PURPOSE
ZSPTRS solves a system of linear equations A*X = B with a complex
symmetric matrix A stored in packed format using the factorization
A = U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T computed by ZSPTRF.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies whether the details of the factorization are stored
as an upper or lower triangular matrix.
= \(aqU\(aq:  Upper triangular, form is A = U*D*U**T;
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  Lower triangular, form is A = L*D*L**T.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
NRHS    (input) INTEGER
The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to
obtain the factor U or L as computed by ZSPTRF, stored as a
packed triangular matrix.
.TP 8
IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
as determined by ZSPTRF.
.TP 8
B       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
On exit, the solution matrix X.
.TP 8
LDB     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
