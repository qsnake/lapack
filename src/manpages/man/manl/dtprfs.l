.SH PURPOSE
DTPRFS provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
solution to a system of linear equations with a triangular packed
coefficient matrix.

The solution matrix X must be computed by DTPTRS or some other
means before entering this routine.  DTPRFS does not do iterative
refinement because doing so cannot improve the backward error.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
= \(aqU\(aq:  A is upper triangular;
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  A is lower triangular.
.TP 8
TRANS   (input) CHARACTER*1
.br
Specifies the form of the system of equations:
.br
= \(aqN\(aq:  A * X = B  (No transpose)
.br
= \(aqT\(aq:  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
.br
= \(aqC\(aq:  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)
.TP 8
DIAG    (input) CHARACTER*1
.br
= \(aqN\(aq:  A is non-unit triangular;
.br
= \(aqU\(aq:  A is unit triangular.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
NRHS    (input) INTEGER
The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The upper or lower triangular matrix A, packed columnwise in
a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored in the array
AP as follows:
if UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
if UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
If DIAG = \(aqU\(aq, the diagonal elements of A are not referenced
and are assumed to be 1.
.TP 8
B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
The right hand side matrix B.
.TP 8
LDB     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
X       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
The solution matrix X.
.TP 8
LDX     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
overestimate of the true error.
.TP 8
BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (3*N)
.TP 8
IWORK   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
