ZHPRFS improves the computed solution to a system of linear
equations when the coefficient matrix is Hermitian indefinite
and packed, and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
for the solution.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
= \(aqU\(aq:  Upper triangle of A is stored;
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  Lower triangle of A is stored.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
NRHS    (input) INTEGER
The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
of the matrices B and X.  NRHS >= 0.
.TP 8
AP      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The upper or lower triangle of the Hermitian matrix A, packed
columnwise in a linear array.  The j-th column of A is stored
in the array AP as follows:
if UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*j/2) = A(i,j) for 1<=i<=j;
if UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, AP(i + (j-1)*(2*n-j)/2) = A(i,j) for j<=i<=n.
.TP 8
AFP     (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N*(N+1)/2)
The factored form of the matrix A.  AFP contains the block
diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**H or
A = L*D*L**H as computed by ZHPTRF, stored as a packed
triangular matrix.
.TP 8
IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
as determined by ZHPTRF.
.TP 8
B       (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
The right hand side matrix B.
.TP 8
LDB     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
X       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by ZHPTRS.
On exit, the improved solution matrix X.
.TP 8
LDX     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
FERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
overestimate of the true error.
.TP 8
BERR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
.TP 8
WORK    (workspace) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)
.TP 8
RWORK   (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
.SH PARAMETERS

ITMAX is the maximum number of steps of iterative refinement.
