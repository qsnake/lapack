.SH PURPOSE
ZLATDF computes the contribution to the reciprocal Dif-estimate
by solving for x in Z * x = b, where b is chosen such that the norm
of x is as large as possible. It is assumed that LU decomposition
of Z has been computed by ZGETC2. On entry RHS = f holds the
contribution from earlier solved sub-systems, and on return RHS = x.

The factorization of Z returned by ZGETC2 has the form
.br
Z = P * L * U * Q, where P and Q are permutation matrices. L is lower
triangular with unit diagonal elements and U is upper triangular.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
IJOB    (input) INTEGER
IJOB = 2: First compute an approximative null-vector e
of Z using ZGECON, e is normalized and solve for
Zx = +-e - f with the sign giving the greater value of
2-norm(x).  About 5 times as expensive as Default.
IJOB .ne. 2: Local look ahead strategy where
all entries of the r.h.s. b is choosen as either +1 or
-1.  Default.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The number of columns of the matrix Z.
.TP 8
Z       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDZ, N)
On entry, the LU part of the factorization of the n-by-n
matrix Z computed by ZGETC2:  Z = P * L * U * Q
.TP 8
LDZ     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDA >= max(1, N).
.TP 8
RHS     (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N).
On entry, RHS contains contributions from other subsystems.
On exit, RHS contains the solution of the subsystem with
entries according to the value of IJOB (see above).
.TP 8
RDSUM   (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
On entry, the sum of squares of computed contributions to
the Dif-estimate under computation by ZTGSYL, where the
scaling factor RDSCAL (see below) has been factored out.
On exit, the corresponding sum of squares updated with the
contributions from the current sub-system.
If TRANS = \(aqT\(aq RDSUM is not touched.
NOTE: RDSUM only makes sense when ZTGSY2 is called by CTGSYL.
.TP 8
RDSCAL  (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
On entry, scaling factor used to prevent overflow in RDSUM.
On exit, RDSCAL is updated w.r.t. the current contributions
in RDSUM.
If TRANS = \(aqT\(aq, RDSCAL is not touched.
NOTE: RDSCAL only makes sense when ZTGSY2 is called by
ZTGSYL.
.TP 8
IPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N).
The pivot indices; for 1 <= i <= N, row i of the
matrix has been interchanged with row IPIV(i).
.TP 8
JPIV    (input) INTEGER array, dimension (N).
The pivot indices; for 1 <= j <= N, column j of the
matrix has been interchanged with column JPIV(j).
