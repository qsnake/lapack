.SH PURPOSE
DLAED2 merges the two sets of eigenvalues together into a single
sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem.
There are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
eigenvalues are close together or if there is a tiny entry in the
Z vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
equation problem is reduced by one.
.br

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 7
K      (output) INTEGER
The number of non-deflated eigenvalues, and the order of the
related secular equation. 0 <= K <=N.
.TP 7
N      (input) INTEGER
The dimension of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix.  N >= 0.
.TP 7
N1     (input) INTEGER
The location of the last eigenvalue in the leading sub-matrix.
min(1,N) <= N1 <= N/2.
.TP 7
D      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
On entry, D contains the eigenvalues of the two submatrices to
be combined.
On exit, D contains the trailing (N-K) updated eigenvalues
(those which were deflated) sorted into increasing order.
.TP 7
Q      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDQ, N)
On entry, Q contains the eigenvectors of two submatrices in
the two square blocks with corners at (1,1), (N1,N1)
and (N1+1, N1+1), (N,N).
On exit, Q contains the trailing (N-K) updated eigenvectors
(those which were deflated) in its last N-K columns.
.TP 7
LDQ    (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array Q.  LDQ >= max(1,N).
.TP 7
INDXQ  (input/output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
The permutation which separately sorts the two sub-problems
in D into ascending order.  Note that elements in the second
half of this permutation must first have N1 added to their
values. Destroyed on exit.
.TP 7
RHO    (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION
On entry, the off-diagonal element associated with the rank-1
cut which originally split the two submatrices which are now
being recombined.
On exit, RHO has been modified to the value required by
DLAED3.
.TP 7
Z      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
On entry, Z contains the updating vector (the last
row of the first sub-eigenvector matrix and the first row of
the second sub-eigenvector matrix).
On exit, the contents of Z have been destroyed by the updating
process.

DLAMDA (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
A copy of the first K eigenvalues which will be used by
DLAED3 to form the secular equation.
.TP 7
W      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
The first k values of the final deflation-altered z-vector
which will be passed to DLAED3.
.TP 7
Q2     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N1**2+(N-N1)**2)
A copy of the first K eigenvectors which will be used by
DLAED3 in a matrix multiply (DGEMM) to solve for the new
eigenvectors.
.TP 7
INDX   (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
The permutation used to sort the contents of DLAMDA into
ascending order.
.TP 7
INDXC  (output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
The permutation used to arrange the columns of the deflated
Q matrix into three groups:  the first group contains non-zero
elements only at and above N1, the second contains
non-zero elements only below N1, and the third is dense.
.TP 7
INDXP  (workspace) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
The permutation used to place deflated values of D at the end
of the array.  INDXP(1:K) points to the nondeflated D-values
.br
and INDXP(K+1:N) points to the deflated eigenvalues.

COLTYP (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (N)
During execution, a label which will indicate which of the
following types a column in the Q2 matrix is:
.br
1 : non-zero in the upper half only;
.br
2 : dense;
.br
3 : non-zero in the lower half only;
.br
4 : deflated.
On exit, COLTYP(i) is the number of columns of type i,
for i=1 to 4 only.
.TP 7
INFO   (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit.
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
