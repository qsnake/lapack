.SH PURPOSE
ZGBEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
M-by-N band matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the
row scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to
make the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have absolute value 1.
.br

R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be between SMLNUM = smallest safe
number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use of these scaling
factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition number of A but
works well in practice.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
M       (input) INTEGER
The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
KL      (input) INTEGER
The number of subdiagonals within the band of A.  KL >= 0.
.TP 8
KU      (input) INTEGER
The number of superdiagonals within the band of A.  KU >= 0.
.TP 8
AB      (input) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAB,N)
The band matrix A, stored in rows 1 to KL+KU+1.  The j-th
column of A is stored in the j-th column of the array AB as
follows:
AB(ku+1+i-j,j) = A(i,j) for max(1,j-ku)<=i<=min(m,j+kl).
.TP 8
LDAB    (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array AB.  LDAB >= KL+KU+1.
.TP 8
R       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M)
If INFO = 0, or INFO > M, R contains the row scale factors
for A.
.TP 8
C       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
If INFO = 0, C contains the column scale factors for A.
.TP 8
ROWCND  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
If INFO = 0 or INFO > M, ROWCND contains the ratio of the
smallest R(i) to the largest R(i).  If ROWCND >= 0.1 and
AMAX is neither too large nor too small, it is not worth
scaling by R.
.TP 8
COLCND  (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
If INFO = 0, COLCND contains the ratio of the smallest
C(i) to the largest C(i).  If COLCND >= 0.1, it is not
worth scaling by C.
.TP 8
AMAX    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION
Absolute value of largest matrix element.  If AMAX is very
close to overflow or very close to underflow, the matrix
should be scaled.
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
.br
> 0:  if INFO = i, and i is
.br
<= M:  the i-th row of A is exactly zero
.br
>  M:  the (i-M)-th column of A is exactly zero
