.SH PURPOSE
Using a divide and conquer approach, DLASD0 computes the singular
value decomposition (SVD) of a real upper bidiagonal N-by-M
matrix B with diagonal D and offdiagonal E, where M = N + SQRE.
The algorithm computes orthogonal matrices U and VT such that
B = U * S * VT. The singular values S are overwritten on D.

A related subroutine, DLASDA, computes only the singular values,
and optionally, the singular vectors in compact form.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 7
N      (input) INTEGER
On entry, the row dimension of the upper bidiagonal matrix.
This is also the dimension of the main diagonal array D.
.TP 7
SQRE   (input) INTEGER
Specifies the column dimension of the bidiagonal matrix.

= 1: The bidiagonal matrix has column dimension M = N+1;
.TP 7
D      (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
On entry D contains the main diagonal of the bidiagonal
matrix.
On exit D, if INFO = 0, contains its singular values.
.TP 7
E      (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (M-1)
Contains the subdiagonal entries of the bidiagonal matrix.
On exit, E has been destroyed.
.TP 7
U      (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension at least (LDQ, N)
On exit, U contains the left singular vectors.
.TP 7
LDU    (input) INTEGER

.TP 7
VT     (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension at least (LDVT, M)
On exit, VT\(aq contains the right singular vectors.
.TP 7
LDVT   (input) INTEGER
On entry, leading dimension of VT.

SMLSIZ (input) INTEGER
On entry, maximum size of the subproblems at the
bottom of the computation tree.
.TP 7
IWORK  (workspace) INTEGER work array.
