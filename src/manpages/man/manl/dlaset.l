.SH PURPOSE
DLASET initializes an m-by-n matrix A to BETA on the diagonal and
ALPHA on the offdiagonals.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
Specifies the part of the matrix A to be set.
= \(aqU\(aq:      Upper triangular part is set; the strictly lower
triangular part of A is not changed.
= \(aqL\(aq:      Lower triangular part is set; the strictly upper
triangular part of A is not changed.
Otherwise:  All of the matrix A is set.
.TP 8
M       (input) INTEGER
The number of rows of the matrix A.  M >= 0.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The number of columns of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
ALPHA   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
The constant to which the offdiagonal elements are to be set.
.TP 8
BETA    (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
The constant to which the diagonal elements are to be set.
.TP 8
A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
On exit, the leading m-by-n submatrix of A is set as follows:

if UPLO = \(aqU\(aq, A(i,j) = ALPHA, 1<=i<=j-1, 1<=j<=n,
if UPLO = \(aqL\(aq, A(i,j) = ALPHA, j+1<=i<=m, 1<=j<=n,
otherwise,     A(i,j) = ALPHA, 1<=i<=m, 1<=j<=n, i.ne.j,

and, for all UPLO, A(i,i) = BETA, 1<=i<=min(m,n).
.TP 8
LDA     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,M).
