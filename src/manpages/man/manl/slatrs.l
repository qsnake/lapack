.SH PURPOSE
SLATRS solves one of the triangular systems
triangular matrix, A\(aq denotes the transpose of A, x and b are
n-element vectors, and s is a scaling factor, usually less than
or equal to 1, chosen so that the components of x will be less than
the overflow threshold.  If the unscaled problem will not cause
overflow, the Level 2 BLAS routine STRSV is called.  If the matrix A
is singular (A(j,j) = 0 for some j), then s is set to 0 and a
non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is returned.

.SH FURTHER DETAILS
A rough bound on x is computed; if that is less than overflow, STRSV
is called, otherwise, specific code is used which checks for possible
overflow or divide-by-zero at every operation.
.br

A columnwise scheme is used for solving A*x = b.  The basic algorithm
if A is lower triangular is
.br

     x[1:n] := b[1:n]
.br
     for j = 1, ..., n
.br
          x(j) := x(j) / A(j,j)
.br
          x[j+1:n] := x[j+1:n] - x(j) * A[j+1:n,j]
.br
     end
.br

Define bounds on the components of x after j iterations of the loop:
   M(j) = bound on x[1:j]
.br
   G(j) = bound on x[j+1:n]
.br
Initially, let M(0) = 0 and G(0) = max{x(i), i=1,...,n}.
.br

Then for iteration j+1 we have
.br
   M(j+1) <= G(j) / | A(j+1,j+1) |
.br
   G(j+1) <= G(j) + M(j+1) * | A[j+2:n,j+1] |
.br
          <= G(j) ( 1 + CNORM(j+1) / | A(j+1,j+1) | )
.br

where CNORM(j+1) is greater than or equal to the infinity-norm of
column j+1 of A, not counting the diagonal.  Hence
.br

   G(j) <= G(0) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / | A(i,i) | )
.br
                1<=i<=j
.br
and
.br

   |x(j)| <= ( G(0) / |A(j,j)| ) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / |A(i,i)| )
                                 1<=i< j
.br

Since |x(j)| <= M(j), we use the Level 2 BLAS routine STRSV if the
reciprocal of the largest M(j), j=1,..,n, is larger than
.br
max(underflow, 1/overflow).
.br

The bound on x(j) is also used to determine when a step in the
columnwise method can be performed without fear of overflow.  If
the computed bound is greater than a large constant, x is scaled to
prevent overflow, but if the bound overflows, x is set to 0, x(j) to
1, and scale to 0, and a non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is found.

Similarly, a row-wise scheme is used to solve A\(aq*x = b.  The basic
algorithm for A upper triangular is
.br

     for j = 1, ..., n
.br
          x(j) := ( b(j) - A[1:j-1,j]\(aq * x[1:j-1] ) / A(j,j)
     end
.br

We simultaneously compute two bounds
.br
     G(j) = bound on ( b(i) - A[1:i-1,i]\(aq * x[1:i-1] ), 1<=i<=j
     M(j) = bound on x(i), 1<=i<=j
.br

The initial values are G(0) = 0, M(0) = max{b(i), i=1,..,n}, and we
add the constraint G(j) >= G(j-1) and M(j) >= M(j-1) for j >= 1.
Then the bound on x(j) is
.br

     M(j) <= M(j-1) * ( 1 + CNORM(j) ) / | A(j,j) |
.br

          <= M(0) * product ( ( 1 + CNORM(i) ) / |A(i,i)| )
                    1<=i<=j
.br

and we can safely call STRSV if 1/M(n) and 1/G(n) are both greater
than max(underflow, 1/overflow).
