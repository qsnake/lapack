.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 8
UPLO    (input) CHARACTER*1
= \(aqU\(aq:  Upper triangle of A is stored;
.br
= \(aqL\(aq:  Lower triangle of A is stored.
.TP 8
N       (input) INTEGER
The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.
.TP 8
NRHS    (input) INTEGER

of the matrix B.  NRHS >= 0.
.TP 8
A       (input) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
The triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky factorization
A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H, as computed by CPOTRF.
.TP 8
LDA     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
B       (input/output) COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
On entry, the right hand side matrix B.
On exit, the solution matrix X.
.TP 8
LDB     (input) INTEGER
The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).
.TP 8
INFO    (output) INTEGER
= 0:  successful exit
.br
< 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
