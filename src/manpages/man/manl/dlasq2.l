.SH NAME
DLASQ2 - all the eigenvalues of the symmetric positive definite tridiagonal matrix associated with the qd array Z to high relative accuracy are computed to high relative accuracy, in the absence of denormalization, underflow and overflow

.SH PURPOSE
DLASQ2 computes all the eigenvalues of the symmetric positive 
definite tridiagonal matrix associated with the qd array Z to high
relative accuracy are computed to high relative accuracy, in the
absence of denormalization, underflow and overflow.

To see the relation of Z to the tridiagonal matrix, let L be a
unit lower bidiagonal matrix with subdiagonals Z(2,4,6,,..) and
let U be an upper bidiagonal matrix with 1\(aqs above and diagonal
Z(1,3,5,,..). The tridiagonal is L*U or, if you prefer, the
symmetric tridiagonal to which it is similar.
.br

Note : DLASQ2 defines a logical variable, IEEE, which is true
on machines which follow ieee-754 floating-point standard in their
handling of infinities and NaNs, and false otherwise. This variable
is passed to DLAZQ3.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 6
N     (input) INTEGER
The number of rows and columns in the matrix. N >= 0.
.TP 6
Z     (workspace) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension ( 4*N )
On entry Z holds the qd array. On exit, entries 1 to N hold
the eigenvalues in decreasing order, Z( 2*N+1 ) holds the
trace, and Z( 2*N+2 ) holds the sum of the eigenvalues. If
N > 2, then Z( 2*N+3 ) holds the iteration count, Z( 2*N+4 )
holds NDIVS/NIN^2, and Z( 2*N+5 ) holds the percentage of
shifts that failed.
.TP 6
INFO  (output) INTEGER
= 0: successful exit
.br
< 0: if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal
value, then INFO = -i, if the i-th argument is an
array and the j-entry had an illegal value, then
INFO = -(i*100+j)
> 0: the algorithm failed
= 1, a split was marked by a positive value in E
= 2, current block of Z not diagonalized after 30*N
iterations (in inner while loop)
= 3, termination criterion of outer while loop not met 
(program created more than N unreduced blocks)
.SH FURTHER DETAILS
The shifts are accumulated in SIGMA. Iteration count is in ITER.
Ping-pong is controlled by PP (alternates between 0 and 1).
